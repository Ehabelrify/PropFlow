## 🏛️ Architecture & Core Concepts

### 1. Multi-Tenancy
PropFlow is built as a SaaS. Every data entity (Leads, Users, Teams) belongs to a `Tenant`.
- **Isolation**: Data is scoped at the database/context level based on the current user's `tenantId`.
- **Subscription Levels**: Support for `starter`, `professional`, and `enterprise` plans.

### 2. State & Data Flow
The application uses a layered provider system in `src/routes/__root.tsx`:
1. **`AuthProvider`**: Manages authentication state and user sessions via Supabase.
2. **`RoleProvider`**: Computes permissions and scopes data based on the active user.
3. **`QueryClientProvider`**: Provides TanStack Query for server state management.

```

### Key Entities
- **Tenant**: An organization (e.g., "Acme Realty").
- **User**: Employees within a tenant. Assigned a specific `Role`.
- **Lead**: The core prospect entity. Tracked via `LeadStage`.
- **Property**: Real estate listings available for sale/rent.
- **Activity**: Audit log of interactions (calls, notes, stage changes).

## 🔐 Security & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

PropFlow implements a strict hierarchy (`OrgRole`):

| Role | Scope | Key Permissions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Super Admin** | Platform-wide | Manage tenants, view all data across all orgs. |
| **Manager** | Tenant-wide | Manage teams, settings, and all leads in their org. |
| **Leader** | Team-wide | View and manage leads/members within their team. |
| **Agent** | Individual | Manage only assigned leads and personal tasks. |

*Implementation can be found in `src/lib/role-context.tsx`.*

## 🤖 For AI Agents & Collaborators

### 🧠 Logic Locations
- **Adding a new data field**: Update `src/lib/types.ts` first, then modify database schema.
- **Modifying Permissions**: Edit the `ROLE_PERMS` object in `src/lib/role-context.tsx`.
- **API Integration**: All data fetching is done via TanStack Query hooks in `src/hooks/use-supabase.ts`.
- **UI Tweaks**: The project uses **Tailwind CSS 4**. Avoid using `@apply` in CSS; prefer inline utility classes for maximum visibility.

### 🎨 Design System
- **Colors**: Uses semantic naming (e.g., `primary`, `success`, `hot`, `warning`).
- **Layout**: Mobile-first responsive design using the `SidebarProvider`.
- **Interactions**: All dialogs and forms should use the patterns established in `src/components/crm/dialogs.tsx`.
